# Gold Fighter

Gold Fighter is a combat-strategy game about killing the other player with weapons in which you can only obtain by digging around in the sand to find gold.

The main idea is you are stuck in a Colluseum-type arena with two vendors on either side. The floor is made of dirt, and somewhere in this dirt are gold nuggets, gold chunks, and gold ingots. Your goal is to gather enough gold before your enemy, get a decent weapon, and kill your enemy before he kills you. 

I find it best to provide an example -- You and your friend start a game. He gets lucky and gets 5 gold nuggets right off the bat. As you just find a gold chunk, he buys a stick from the vendor and begins to chase you with it. Lucky for you, you quickly buy a cheaply-made sword and destroy his stick, and kill him.
